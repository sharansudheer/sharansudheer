#### My name is Sharan 😁 ❤️

### All I need is A Spark, A Point, A Road to Begin my Professional Career

- **I am a Software Developer with a Dash of Application Security and greatly interested in Network, Application and Hardware Security.**

- Focusing Primarily On :-
  - Web Back-End Development - ASP.NET Core, Redis, PostgreSQL and MS SQL
  - Web App, API and DB Security (By-product of Development 😂)
  - Software Architecture
  - Database Design
  - Basic Wire-Framing
  - Native Android Development

- Orthodox, maybe an unorthodox Scrum master, probably a janitor driving a Scrubmaster at a Retailer.<br>Because how else am I supposed to manage over 5 projects concurrently without introducing **Priority Inversion**.<br><br>

**Building an Empire, eh probably an Umpire, Parley?**<br><br>

- **Also a DIY Handyman working around Old HiFi Systems, Electronics, Cars, Computers, Lego, Home Wiring and Motorcycles.**

- **I am a Computer Science and Engineering Graduate from Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Class of 2023.**<br><br>


- **I am completely Self motivated and Self Driven, by my Business Goals and Interview Prep(technically another Business Goal 😂 ). So as an Internal Combustion Engine(not), Nice requires fuel. Haven't transitioned to Nuclear.**

- Business Goals as in -<br>**Hey, I am a Brand myself 😂**<br><br>A Software Engineer, Any Professional is a unique Brand, isn't it? 
  - But here, because of my situation - A **Cosplay**, as well. Eh sort of 😬 😬 - 
    - Like working on Software Projects that quench my Thirst to Feel Like, Yess I am Employed and I am a part of Something Big.
    - Like a Research and Development Engineer.
    - Find Problems, Plan and Craft Solutions.
    - Some are related to finding solutions to the challenges that I faced during the planning phase of my personal domain.
  - Others to Feel like I am in the Shoes of developing a Product under a Brand.


## My Tech Stack:- 

- <b>LANGUAGES</b> :-  C, C++, Java, C#, Native Android Development, Rust, Go

Go(Mainly for Research in Distributed Systems and IPC, Message Passing - Event Driven Architecture)

- <b>FRAMEWORKS</b> :- Spring Boot, ASP.NET, Axum

- <b>DATABASES</b> :-  Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL

(Have used MariaDB, Hadoop and Cassandra as a part of under grad as well)

**My Tech Stack is Kinda Small.<br>Me and JavaScript Haven't Reached <b>An ACCORD</b> Through A <b> PARLEY</b>.<br><br>Using Vite to setup a ReactJS project with Tailwind was the Final Nail in the Coffin that drove me Gaga 💃🏻🕺🏻.**

## Now the Boorriinngg or 😃 the Exciting Stuff - My Mind Vomit 😂:- 

**As you can already tell - I don't want to copy a Profile readme file,because everyone does it and it wouldn't describe my personality, not even at least for a percentage of it.**

- I hate JS because it tends to be a Bas.. Bass Guitarist and Son of a Bi.. BitLocker with type casting, function calls and etc.

- I love Lego, probably its the only other relationship I have apart from GitHub. Have been working on Lego sets since 2008 and on Lego MindStorms 2.0 from 2011 until 2019, the main brick got bricked during an Update. 

- I have no mentors or guides or friend in this realm other than few ebooks and The person who cannot be totally reliable, who's vibe doesn't match with my old school style, Mrs Chatgpt. 
 
- Guides being university notes and documentations. Building up an army of repositories so in the case of a  freelance work I don't become stuck like "Holy Shite Balls".
<br><br>

**I have nobody(except eh, my parents?🤔🤒) and<br> I am my own Everybody.**
 
**Some days I have the energy, Some days I don't. <br><br>Hence my GitHub Commit history Is looking More like a Checkered Flag 🏁 🏁 🏳️ 🏳️, rather than like a Green Flag ✅<br>Like I have Relationship and Commitment Issues 💔.**<br>

**Cheee, Using that analogy to explain the situation happening over here, is A Flop ❌ . Ehhh, let me try again.<br><br> Aha 💡 😃 , like this dialogue:-<br><br>
"Carina Smyth: No, no I’m a Horologist.<br>
Scrum: So was my mum but she didn’t cry as loud as you.<br>
Carina Smyth: You saying your mother was academically inclined?<br>
Jack Sparrow: More like horizontally, reclined."**

<br>

### Hey At Least I am a Green flag 😉 ❤️

<br>

**Thank you for sticking along till the end of my dump of emotions 😍 ,<br> More of my mind vomit can be found - ["Here"](https://github.com/sharansudheer/museum-of-projects)**

**Running on Decaliters of Coffee ☕️ ☕️<br><br>
Brewed so strong, that it will burn your Soul Aawwaayy 💀 because of the bitterness and absence of sweeteners.<br><br>
Jokes aside, I prefer either A Flat White with maybe an extra shot of espresso or while I am at Home or Traveling, I would mix up an Americano concoction without sugar using Nescafe Gold (about 2-3 tsp, 10-15g approx)**

### Byeeeee ❤️
 

 <!-- - An Electrician, eh a DIY guy who knows stuff by learning it through understanding the requirements of the home, discussing and working under the guidance of a licensed Electrician, tasks like assembling a switch panel which might be having 2 incoming phases eg a R phase and B phase for load distribution, or maybe an UPS line, etc. When I took up the charge of upgrading my grand parents home's Single Phase 240VAC, 32A service to Three Phase, 240VAC, 64A service in 2018 
 
 ### Eh unedited from here below
  etc like the John Sinclair of Engineering(the sweet version of the OG Sins(Éclair, Sinclair - get it 🤣🤌🏻)
I have no mentors, guides other than few ebooks and the person who cannot be totally reliable, whos vibe doesn't match with my old school style chatgpt. I have nobody and I am my own Everybody

Some days I have the energy some days I don't and hence my commit green flag is looking more like a checkered flag 

Hey atleast I am a Green flag 😉

 Building up an army of repositories so in the case of a  freelance work I don't become stuck like "Holy Shite Balls"

And just to explore tech stacks that I find to be interesting or related to Uni, like trying to conquer a land and become a self proclaimed Emperor

What is on the outside doesn't matter much as long as what is on the inside is solid 

Frontend vs backend

I don't want money as a support but a nice stable job

Don't worry, open source is my unpaid therapist in a right way. A place to dump my mind vomit

I don't want to copy a profile readme file cause everyone does it and it wouldn't describe my personality at least for a percentage of it -->
